   INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ON SELENIUM
 QUESTION 1?
 What is a WebElement?
A WebElement is a rep of html element generally, So FindElement returns a reference variable of webelement in which we can use the object to call another method.
  e.g webElement obj = findelementbyname("fld_name");
      obj.sendkeys();.
      
    QUESTION 2?  
 QUESTION  =WHAT IS THE DIFFERENT BETWEEN NAVIGATE AND GET METHODS?
    ANSWERS == GET METHOD HAS ONLY ONE FUNCTIONALITY WHICH IS ONLY TO GET THE URL,
     WHILE NAVIGATE HAS MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITY LIKE URL,BACK,FORWARD,REFRESH ETC 
	
	QUESTION 3?
	 WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLOSE AND QUIT BROWSER?
	ANSWER == CLOSE IS USE TO CLOSE ONLY the current WINDOW OR POPUP you are on,
	 WHILE QUIT IS USE TO QUIT OR CLOSE ALL THE WINDOWS OR POPUP.
      
      
      QUESTION 4?
      WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIST AND SELECT WITH DETAILED EXAMPLES in SELENIUM
      ANSWERS === LIST IS USE TO DISPLAY ALL THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS IN THE LIST ITEMS, OR IN A SELECTED TAG
      a)TO GET THE LIST OF ALL AVAILABLE OPTIONS,YOU HAVE TO CREATE A LIST OF WEbELEMENT AND USE A FOR EACH LOOP TO GET THE OPTION BELONGING TO THAT SELECTED TAG WITH A METHOD getAllSelectedOption
      e.g ::Select country = new Select();
       List<WebElement> options = country.getAllSelectedOption();
      for(WebElement a:option){
      system.out.println(a.getText());
      }
      WHILE SELECT IS USE TO SELECT OR CHOOSE ONLY ONE OPTION IN A DROPDOWN
      a)IN SELECT YOU ONLY USE A  METHOD THAT SAYS getFistSelectedOption
       e.g ::Select country = new Select();
       country.getFirstSelctedOption().getText; //NOTE: We use a getText method to get the actual text,cause only the getFirstSelctedOption() does not return a text
       
     QUESTION 5?
     IN A WEBSITE THAT HAS A SCROLL BAR,WHAT KEYS IN THE ACION KEY ARE YOU GOING TO USE TO SCROLL IT DOWN
     ANSWERS == WE USE THE PAGEDOWN OR PAGEUP SPECIAL KEY STIMUTENOUSLY,TO PERFORM IT MULTIPLE TIMES RUN THE SAME METHOD IN A LOOP
     
     
     QUESTION 6?
     WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PAGETIMEOUT, IMPLICIT, EXPLICIT AND FLUENT WAIT?
     ANSWERS === a) PAGETIMEOUT IS USE TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT PAGE LOAD TIME OF THE DRIVER, IT'S A WEBDRIVER LIBRARY,INTERGRITED WITH WEBDRIVER LIBRARY,NEED TO WRITE ONLY ONCE, BY DEFAULT DRIVER WAIT FOR PAGE TO LOAD IN 60SECONDS.
     EXAMPLE : driver.manage().TimeOuts().pageLoadTimeOut(60,Timeunits.SECONDS);
      b) IMPLICIT WAIT ONLY WORKS ON SEARCH COMMANDS WHICH MEANS ITS ONLY APPLICABLE ON ONLY FINDELEMENTS COMMANDS AND IS WRITTEN ONLY ONCE AND APPLICATION ON ALL THE FINDELEMENT COMMAND ON YOUR TEXT.
      EXAMPLE : driver.manage().TimeOuts().implicitlywait(60,Timeunits.SECONDS);
      c) EXPLICIT WAIT IS USE FOR ELEMENT PROPERTY/CONDITION TO SATISFY BEFORE MOVING TO NEXT STEP, ITS USE TO HANDLE AJAX, ITS CAN BE ACHIEVE BY USING WEBDRIVER LIBARARY, WEBDRIVER WAIT CLASS IS PRESENT TO PERFORM THIS WAIT, CONDITIONS NEED TO APPLY FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS.
      EXAMPLE : WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,Duration.ofSeconds(20));
      wait until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElement(driver.findElement(By.name("email"))));
      
      NOTE::: YOU CAN USE IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT WAIT TOGETHER, WHILE IMPLICIT WAIT FINDS THE ELEMENT, EXPLICIT WAITS FOR CONDITION TO BE MET.
